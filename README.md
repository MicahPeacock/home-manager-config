# Home Manager Configuration
This is my own personal Home Manager configuration, which holds my settings, apps, and dotfiles that I wish to import onto my own systems.
I set these up to be used on two seperate machines (which I dual-boot):
- The first machine is "Jupiter", which is my gaming desktop (currently running SteamOS).
- The second machine is "Minerva", which is my general purpose, work, and development desktop (running LMDE 7).

This flake installs apps/settings like:
- Terminal Emulators: [WezTerm, Kitty, or Alacritty]
- Interactive Shells: [bash, zsh, or fish]
- Desktop Fonts/Themes
- GPU/Fan Utilites: [LACT and CoolerControl]
- Syncthing

This was primarily built to help reduce the headache of a reinstallation, as well as make my personal setup more portable.

You can feel free to use this configuration, or even fork it. But I would emphasize caution as the settings are built primarily for my own system, and I cannot guarantee this will work on yours.

I'm also open to comments/discussions, as this is heavily a Work-in-Progress and I'm still new to Nix, so I'm eager to learn.
